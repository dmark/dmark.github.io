	<h1 class="post-title">It Was The Very Worst Butter</h1>
	<span class="post-date">Sun 15 August 2021</span>
	<p>Hands down the worst motorcycle trip I have ever been on. Almost 9 days of
rain, fog, and cold. Don't let the cheerier photos below fool you. They were
but mere moments of respite from the vengeful skies.</p>
<h1>Day 1 - Thessalon</h1>
<p>Starting off on the wrong foot, I left Kingston on the day of our trip rather
than going to Richmond Hill the day before. My usual crew is in Richmond Hill
so, depending on where we are going they typically come to Kingston the day
before, or I go there the day before, so no one is pulling an extra long day.
But I did not do that in this case.</p>
<p>With a 9AM scheduled departure from Richmond Hill I had to leave Kingston at
around 6AM and I was in for an 840km day, my longest single day to date. And I
had had a shite sleep the night before.</p>
<p>We met up at our first planned stop, a Tim's somewhere up highway 400. Shortly
after leaving that first stop the rain started up and stayed with us all the
way to Thessalon. But the day ended on a decent note with a very nice if
somewhat chilly lakeside dinner.</p>
<p>Rear tire seems to be a bit low on air.</p>
<h1>Day 2 - Terrace Bay</h1>
<p>Woke up to rain, and it did not let up. Rain and fog for about 540kms, coupled
with the surprisingly twisty roads from Thessalon to Terrace Bay. This would
have been a pretty choice ride in nicer weather. That's me up there in the fog.</p>
<p><img alt="Good Times" src="/images/pickle-lake/IMG_1665.JPG# default bordered"></p>
<p>There were some good moments though.</p>
<p><img alt="Actually Good Times" src="/images/pickle-lake/IMG_1664.JPG# default bordered"></p>
<p>Topped up my rear tire again. So weird.</p>
<h1>Day 3 - Ignace</h1>
<p>More of the same. Heavy fog and overcast skies. The weather let up by the time
we got to Ignace and we enjoyed some sunshine on the lake. </p>
<p><img alt="Ignace" src="/images/pickle-lake/IMG_1660.JPG# default bordered"></p>
<p>That was until an absolute monster of a storm rolled across the lake right at
us. Howling winds, torrential rains, a 10 - 15C drop in temperature. Decent
sunset after the storm though.</p>
<p><img alt="Ignace" src="/images/pickle-lake/IMG_1663.JPG# default bordered"></p>
<p>Oh right, this is when I finally discovered the nail in my tire.</p>
<p><img alt="Fuck" src="/images/pickle-lake/IMG_1661.JPG# default bordered"></p>
<h1>Day 4 - Backtracking</h1>
<p>We were supposed to head to Pickle Lake today. Instead my buddy and I
backtracked to Thunder Bay to have my tire patched at <a href="https://www.excaliburmotorcycle.com/">Excalibur
Motorcycle</a>. My buddy's In-laws were with
us on this trip, driving their "chase truck" so they continued on to Pickle
Lake with my buddy's Wife.</p>
<p>Of course, a massive storm rolled in while we were at Excalibur and dumped on
us most of the way back to Ignace. It did break about 3/4s of the way back and
we had another decent lakeside sunset.</p>
<p><img alt="Ignace" src="/images/pickle-lake/IMG_1668.JPG# default bordered"></p>
<h1>Day 5 - Pickle Lake</h1>
<p>Finally off to Pickle Lake. When we arrived it was cloudly and the wind rolling
across the lake directly at us was absolutely brutal.</p>
<p><img alt="Pickle Lake" src="/images/pickle-lake/IMG_1672.JPG# default bordered"></p>
<p>That's a deceptive picture. It's damn cold and windy.</p>
<p>The Pickle Lake Hotel has a fun little Tiki patio on the water. That was
supposed to be our mid-trip break, a chance to have some adult beverages and
relax, but nothing doing. We were holed up inside.</p>
<p>If you ever head up this way, don't be fooled by Google Maps. It's only about
3.5 hours from Ignace.</p>
<h1>Day 6 - English River</h1>
<p>Leaving the next morning it was windy and colder still. More of the same. Cold,
rain, wind. Spent the night at the English River Inn. The proprietors were
cooking up some manner of east Asian curry dinner and by thunder did it ever
smell good. I should have asked if they had any leftovers.</p>
<h1>Day 7 and Beyond</h1>
<p>I mean, I'm just repeating myself over and over, right? To Longlac for a night
at an absolute dive of a motel, then Kirkland Lake and much better
accomodations.</p>
<h1>Finally...</h1>
<p>On our last day, riding home from Kirkland Lake, it finally warmed up and we
had a decent ride. I decided to pull another long haul and rode all the way
back to Kingston, rather than doing an overnight in Richmond Hill. I really
just wanted to get home. And doing so gave me the opportunity to take highway
17 all the way to Pembroke which I hadn't done before.</p>
<p>3/10 would not recommend.</p>
