<h1>Requirements</h1>
<h2>Self-motivated, quick learner, fast researcher, and hungry to improve technical skills.</h2>
<p>I love digging into new technology, and like many technologists, this is both a vocation, and a hobby. It is pretty common for me to spend a good part of my off hours working on my <a href="https://github.com/dmark?tab=repositories">github projects</a> or technical certifications or, these days, digging into the OAuth and OIDC RFCs, specs, and mailing lists.</p>
<p>I frequently take a leadership position in the adoption of new technology, including leading my current employer's adoption of cloud computing platforms and services such as Auth0, Google Cloud Platform, and Amazon Web Services.</p>
<h2>Love to code and solve technical issues varying in complexity and technology.</h2>
<p>I enjoy solving technical problems and, while not a professional software engineer, I love to solving such problems with code. A succinct bit of PEP8 compliant python code is a joy to behold! I have been making an explicit effort to build out a bit of a public github portfolio (most of my past code belonging to my employer and not open-source).</p>
<h2>Good at empathizing with developers and have experience with troubleshooting environments.</h2>
<p>While my role has always involved supporting developers, for the past two and half years I have been embedded with our web application / "digital transformation" product development team, providing them with operational "SRE" support. "My developers" have come to rely on me as someone who can help resolve their technical challenges.</p>
<h2>Excellent written and verbal communication skills (English) and passionate about talking to developers.</h2>
<p>See the next bullet.</p>
<h2>Enjoy writing and teaching, capable of explaining complex concepts in easy-to-understand language.</h2>
<p>I have often been in the position of teaching / communicating complex technology to others, and many times I have been commended on my ability to explain complex topics in a way that makes it easy for other to understand. My public speaking skills are likely a bit rusty, but I used to give public presentations on technically deep subject matter to my local Linux Users Group (q.v.) every month or two.</p>
<h2>Have experience with dealing with a forum and are comfortable with a remote working environment.</h2>
<p>Outside the Auth0 Community, my forum experience is limited. I participate in many forums (stackoverflow, motorcycle forums) but it hasn't been something I engage in frequently. I made an explicit decision to be active in the Auth0 Community so I could more rapidly develop my own expertise with Auth0 and related technologies.</p>
<p>I have been informally working from home for a few years now. For me, working from home means increased productivity, and improved work-life balance. I am better able to focus on my tasks. My employer gets higher quality results, while I eat and sleep better and get more exercise.</p>
<h2>Love to contribute to the open source community.</h2>
<p>I've been a participant in open source since 1994. I founded the second iteration of the Kingston Linux Users Group in 1999 (wow ... -&gt; http://www.klug.on.ca/) and largely single-handedly ran the group and most of its events / meetings / presentations until the group disbanded in 2003.</p>
<p>More recently I have been more actively engaging in the development community, offering minor PRs and documenting issues for various projects.</p>
<h2>Proven experience working or participating in a developer community.</h2>
<p>I believe my record as a <a href="https://community.auth0.com/u/markd/summary">participant in the Auth0 Community</a> speaks for itself! As mentioned, I dove in to better educate myself, and whenever I can I try to help others. There's no better test of your knowledge of a subject than teaching others! For whatever it might be worth, I recently realized that I have the third highest number of "thumbs ups received" of "all time" (however far back the stats go). The Top Ten thumbs ups users are 9 Auth0 employees (or ex-employees), and me! I'm not saying it's a competition ... I'm just saying there's some "there there".</p>
<h2>Attention to detail.</h2>
<p>I enjoy creating detailed technical documentation. I'm a stickler for precise use of language and terminology. I love code that passes linting.</p>
<h1>Bonus Attributes</h1>
<h2>Experience with OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect.</h2>
<p>While I am relatively new to OAuth and OIDC, I have a good grasp of both protocols, and I have written some amount of code that interfaces with Auth0 using python with both Auth0's python SDK and direct REST calls, pyjwt, Authlib, and I have been building an Auth0 CLI using node.js, typescript, oclif, and Auth0's node.js SDK.</p>
<h2>Experience moderating a forum.</h2>
<p>While I have no experience moderating a forum, I do have some experience running a Community, namely the KLUG as mentioned above.</p>
<h2>Fluent communication in languages other than English and Spanish.</h2>
<p>I am an English speaker. I used to be fluent in French as well, having lived in Quebec for four years, and I have started taking steps to regain my French fluency. To that end (and to knock off some elective credits) I will be taking French language courses with my local University over the next couple years.</p>
<h1>Anything else?</h1>
<p>The prospect of working for Auth0 is super exciting. I've really enjoyed helping out in the Community, and I'm excited to engage in some real world advocacy as well (I'll be giving an Auth0 Lightning Talk to my local Developer's Meetup on March 13th). If I'm successful, I look forward to hammering on my Auth0 / OAuth / OIDC skills... I still have designs on that Identity Architecture &amp; Content Padawan position!</p>
<p>Apropos of nothing in particular, I am an <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/drumboots">avid reader</a>, and avid gamer, and an avid motorcyclist.</p>
