<p>The one that started it all, more or less. I bought myself a Rotring ArtPen
sometime around 1984 - 1986, so at around 12 - 14 years old. My Father was in
the Canadian Military and we were living in Germany at the time. I recall doing
some fountain pen related artwork in school, and somewhere in there I had
gotten into calligraphy. I was into European Medieval history, playing Dungeons
&amp; Dragons, and in all of this I developed a thing for fountain pens. So I
bought myself a Rotring ArtPen. I was completely uninformed, and in my usual
way refused to ask anyone else for guidance. I bought the ArtPen because I
liked the look of it. What kind of weirdo brings a fountain pen to class in the
7th grade?</p>
<p>That pen is long lost but I would often think about it. Well into adulthood I
could remember that pen very clearly. And I mean, I could still recall the feel
of the pen in my hand, the rough texture, the ribbed section, the taper of the
body, even the sharp edges of the clip. And I could still bring to mind the
distinctive click of the lid. Only I could not for the life of me remember what
the name of make of the pen was. For a long time I thought it was a Staedler
and spent more than a little time searching images of Staedler fountain pens to
no avail.</p>
<p>One day recently I was looking at other fountain pens and happened to be
browsing Faber-Castell models when it clicked... "maybe my pen was a
Faber-Castell?" More searching to no avail but I quickly clued in. I knew the
pen was German. What other German pen manufacturers could it be! In very short
order I had rediscovered my pen! To eBay I went and I was very happy to see
plenty of Rotring ArtPens for sale. I had to have one. It is somewhat
impractical being unusually long, but for nostaligic reasons alone I had to buy
it. So I ordered one from one of the eBay sellers and I am very happy to have
this in my possession. Alas, one minor challenge: I ordered a fine nibbed model
but the seller send my a broad. I mean, I wasn't reallt planning to use it for
regular writing anyway, but the broad nib in this thing lays down a sea of ink
rendering it pretty useless for my purposes. Oh well.</p>
