	<h1 class="post-title">My Year in Books 2018</h1>
	<span class="post-date">Mon 31 December 2018</span>
	<h2>Books and All Sorts of Books</h2>
<p><img alt="The Stack" src="/images/2019-01-04 16.55.25.jpg# default bordered" title="The Stack"></p>
<p>I like to read. I track my reading habits on
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/">Goodreads</a>, and I started using the Goodreads
annual Reading Challenge a couple years ago. For 2018 I set out to read 24
books, but I blew past 24 books fairly quickly, so I changed my goal to 36
books. Down to the wire, I squeezed out the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36319077-the-case-against-education">last
book</a>
on December 31st.</p>
<p>I knocked out an unusually high number of fictional works in 2018. As a huge
fan the of the video game <a href="https://thewitcher.com/en/witcher3">The Witcher 3: Wild
Hunt</a>, I wanted to read the
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/40911">books</a> upon which the game was based.
In a bit of a mad dash to get to 36 books for the year, I started binging the
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/45175">Harry Potter</a> series over the
Christmas holiday season.</p>
<h2>The Breakdown</h2>
<h3>The Good</h3>
<p>Books I particularly enjoyed:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34427077-against-democracy">"Against Democracy"</a> - <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3345266.Jason_Brennan">Jason Brennan</a></li>
</ul>
<p>An excellent book for anyone who grew up believing in universal voting rights.
You wouldn't trust your mechanic to perform open heart surgery. Why would you
trust your equally unqualified fellow citizens to exercise voting power over
you? Shouldn't we leave voting to the experts, those qualified to vote? If you
find that a shocking idea, read the book.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34348306-suicide-of-the-west">"Suicide of the West"</a> - <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/50989.Jonah_Goldberg">Jonah Goldberg</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Somewhat like "Against Democracy", Jonah Goldberg's latest is nother great read
for any left-leaning <a href="https://neoliberalproject.org/">neoliberal</a> shill like
myself. And by that I mean any left-leaning person might find themselves a bit
challenged by the content. A great book that struck many chords.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9854.The_End_of_Poverty">"The End of Poverty"</a> - <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6440.Jeffrey_D_Sachs">Jeffrey D. Sachs</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This was an optional but suggested reading for the 2nd year course I took in
the Fall of 2018, "<a href="http://www.econ.queensu.ca/academics/undergraduate/calendar/280">ECON 280 Population and Economic
Change</a>". Am I
ever glad I read it! While Sachs' <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Villages_Project">Millenium Villages
Project</a> has met
some scrutiny, and the results of the MVP project are questionable, the book is
still a powerful and positive message about the power of economic development.</p>
<p>A mildly interesting aside: I could not shake the feeling that this book was
very familiar. Had I read it before? A few chapters in I realized why it was
familiar: Sachs' work was attacked a number of times in Naomi Klein's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1237300.The_Shock_Doctrine">The
Shock
Doctrine</a>,
which I read back in 2006 - 2007. Very interesting to read the "other side" of
the story and, on balance, I have to say Klein's book was built on some serious
cherry picking of Sachs' history. That said, I'm inclined to go back and read
The Shock Doctrine again.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24042563-sapiens">"Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind"</a> - <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/395812.Yuval_Noah_Harari">Yuval Noah Harari</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Not much to say ... an excellent read. The follow-up book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31138556-homo-deus?ac=1&amp;from_search=true">Homo
Deus</a>
is in my to do pile.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22295085-the-charter-of-rights-and-freedoms">"The Charter of Rights and Freedoms"</a> - <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1276389.Ian_Greene">Ian Greene</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I've been reading a lot of politics lately. This is a really good read. It
summarizes numerous important Charter cases. Critical to understanding the
practical implications of the Charter here in Canada.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/632901.What_Matters_Most_is_How_Well_You_Walk_Through_the_Fire">"What Matter Most is How Well You Walk Through the Fire"</a> - <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/13275.Charles_Bukowski">Charles Bukowski</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I am neither a poet, nor much into poetry. However, on YouTube there is a great
mashup of Bukowski's "<a href="https://bukowski.net/database/detail.php?w=2597&amp;Title=roll-the-dice">Roll the
Dice</a>"
(read by Tom O'Bedlam) and a weigthlifting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvmirhssnxY">insirational
video</a> featuring <a href="http://www.donnyshankleweightlifting.com/">Donny
Shankle</a>, former member of the <a href="https://www.teamusa.org/USA-Weightlifting">US
Weightlifting Team</a>. I bought some
of Bukowski's books as a direct result of that video!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14096.Wherever_You_Go_There_You_Are">"Wherever You Go, There You Are"</a> - <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8750.Jon_Kabat_Zinn">Jon Kabat-Zinn</a></li>
</ul>
<p>One of the better mindfulness meditation books I have read. Almost completely
<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/woo-woo">woo</a>-free, short
"chapters" discussing specific points, and includes exercises to assist your
practice.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41077238-stubborn-attachments">"Stubborn Attachments"</a> - <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/54393.Tyler_Cowen">Tyler Cowan</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I'm a big <a href="http://tylercowen.com/">Tyler Cowan</a> fan and this is a wonderful
"positive messages" book about economic growth, morality, rights and
obligations.</p>
<p>Mildly interesting aside: This book comes from <a href="https://press.stripe.com/">Stripe
Press</a>, and they produce a very small number of
books on progressive topics in economics and technology. I did not know this
until after I had received my copy, but Stripe Press was created by
<a href="https://stripe.com/about">Stripe</a>, the payments company.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10383597-arguably">"Arguably: Selected Essays"</a> - <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3956.Christopher_Hitchens">Christopher Hitchens</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I'm an even bigger Hitchens fan than I am a Cowan fan. His early death is a
loss for all of us. Amongst this collection of essays, my favourites are those
politically oriented, but his book reviews are also very interesting. I read a
ton but I am not really up to speed on "literature", contemporary or classical.
Hitchens' book reviews provide a lot of fodder for future reading.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36319077-the-case-against-education">"The Case Against Education"</a> - <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/373203.Bryan_Caplan">Bryan Caplan</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Probably my favourite read of the year. With my Daughter in her 3rd year and as
a part-time undergrad myself, this was particularly on point.</p>
<h3>The Bad</h3>
<p>Books that were particularly terrible:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10932958-mindfulness-in-plain-english">"Mindfullness in Plain English"</a> - <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/9834164.Henepola_Gunaratana">Henepola Gunaratana</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A terrible book on mindfulness, full of woo and little to no practical value.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21425047-bushcraft-101">"Bushcraft 101"</a> - <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5778255.Dave_Canterbury">Dave Cantebury</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I have no idea how this became a NYT best seller. It is not an instructional
book. At best it surveys the various bushcraft skills that should prove useful
to you should you need them. You will need to look elsewhere if you actually
want to learn those skills. My old Scout books were much better.</p>
<h3>The Rest</h3>
<p>Everything else ... all good, all recommended, just not as noteworthy as those
mentioned above.</p>
