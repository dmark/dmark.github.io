	<h1 class="post-title">I Broke My GS</h1>
	<span class="post-date">Mon 17 July 2017</span>
	<p>I broke my GS.</p>
<p>No injuries other than my pride. Less than a second's worth of inattention and
I dropped my bike at a gas station while I was out joy riding this past Sunday
(July 16th). The resulting chaos was impressive for such a silly little
tip-over.</p>
<p>I had taken back roads all the way out to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawkesbury,_Ontario">Hawkesbury</a> and was
returning home via highway 17. There was a convenient gas station and Tim's in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_and_Plantagenet">Alfred</a>. A top up would
get me home without stopping and it was time for some water and a snack. Gas
station was first so I pulled up to a pump.</p>
<p>This is where less than a second of inattention comes in. I didn't ensure my
kick stand was fully engaged before I started to lean the bike over. And down
it went. Once a bike starts to go, it's real hard to stop it. One moment I'm
looking at the price of Premium and the next moment I'm staring at my toppled
over moto underneath me. I admit I was confused for a bit.</p>
<p>Well, an opportunity to work on my deadlift. Initially it seemed like a total
non-event. Some minor scuffs on the plastic. Sad, but it is a GS after all.
Everything looked to be in order so I proceeded to fill up. Yes, I should have
confirmed it was operable first! Paid for my gas, got geared back up, jumped in
the saddle and turned on the power. Motion by my left foot caught my eye. I
looked down to see gasoline <em>gushing</em> out of my motorcycle.</p>
<p>I was a little stunned. In some sort of state of shock. With my wits mostly
going off in various directions I turned off the power and wheeled the bike out
of the way. Had a closer look, removed a piece of 'protective' bodywork and saw
the damage. The exterior portion of my fuel injector had been sheared off! I'll
not repeat what I was thinking of BMW while staring at this obviously horribly
exposed piece of critical equipment!</p>
<p><img alt="Some fragile components" src="/images/i-broke-my-gs-1.jpg# default bordered"></p>
<p>How could this happen?! As it turned out, when the bike tipped over, it was
positioned so that the cylinder head fell just beside the pump's concrete
island, which allowed the lip of the concrete island to impact the fuel
injector assembly, which is protected only by a heavy plastic cover. Not much
protection when the weight of the bike is laying on it. Had the bike been an
inch or so closer or farther from the pump, I'd have escaped with just the
scratched plastics.</p>
<p>I was 250kms from home.</p>
<h1>CAA to the Rescue? More or Less...</h1>
<p>I called <a href="https://www.caasco.com/">CAA</a> at 6:16PM. They were busy so it was a
bit of a wait before someone could take my call. After initially logging the
call they had to transfer me to the "Ontario East" region (my "home" region
being something else) so I was on hold again. Finally by 7:27PM a truck was on
its way to pick me up!</p>
<p>Just kidding. That's just what the text message from CAA said. At around 7:53PM
the dispatcher called to see if the truck had arrived. No. Ok, so they'll try
calling the driver and get back to me. Text message with an ETA update.</p>
<p>8:12PM - Dispatch calls to see if the truck has arrived. Nope. Oh... we're
having trouble getting in touch with the driver. We'll get back to you. Text
message with an ETA update. (Maybe call another truck?!)</p>
<p>8:34PM - Dispatch calls to see if the truck has arrived. Nien. The driver is
not answering his phone. (But seriously, just call another bloody truck!) But
dispatch insists on trying once more. It's getting dark and starting to rain.
The gas station owners have closed up shop and headed home.</p>
<p>45 minutes goes by with not a word from dispatch. So I call CAA again. On hold
again. Transferred to East again. On hold again. Finally speaking to another
dispatcher and they too try calling the original driver but aren't having any
luck. CALL ANOTHER TRUCK!</p>
<p>9:38PM - Finally dispatch sends out a new driver with a 40 minute ETA. But Lady
Luck was smiling upon me that day! The new driver is there in about 20 minutes.
And this kid was great. He got me squared away real quick. We stopped at that
Tim's I was going to stop at 3+ hours ago for some coffee, and had a nice chat
with some random moto guy whose daughter actually works at the dealership where
I bought my R1200GS, and the dealership CAA was going to haul it to.</p>
<p><img alt="Loaded up" src="/images/i-broke-my-gs-2.jpg# default bordered"></p>
<p>An hour later we dropped the bike off at dealership. The driver was kind enough
to drop me off at my hotel. I suspect the dispatcher told him to go the extra
mile on this call. Still, kudos to that young lad from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RemorquageLeducTowing/">Leduc
towing</a>, and a pox on CAA and
the guy from Garage Lamarche who was supposed to pick me up. <strong>Whose shop was,
by the by, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/E1bQP5oYnUk">1 minute down the road</a> from the
gas station where I was stuck!</strong></p>
<p>So, first call at 6:19PM. Dropped the bike off at around Midnight. Around 6
hours to move a motorcycle 83kms. CAA dispatch should not have waited anywhere
near so long before sending another driver. And I shouldn't have waited so long
to start telling them to send another driver.</p>
<p>Lessons learned:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lean on dispatch hard right away to send another vehicle,</li>
<li>Call BMW Roadside Assistance ... maybe their response would have been better.</li>
</ol>
<h1>At the Dealership</h1>
<p>So the next day (Monday, July 17th), I was at the dealership well before
opening. Once the shop opened I got my bike logged in and was immediately told
it would be a day or two before it even gets looked at it. I was a little
dismayed. I asked the guy at the desk if someone could at just take a quick
look. Which he did. Which wasn't very helpful. Their BMW mechanic could have
taken a 30 second glance and told me what he thought.</p>
<p>For the record, if you're a
<a href="https://www.harley-davidson.com/ca/en/index.html">Harley-Davidson</a> owner and
you break down while traveling the nearest H-D dealership will put your bike at
the front of the line for assessment and, if possible, repair. I really truly
completely love my GS, but BMW could learn something here.</p>
<p>So I caught a cab to the train station and booked a lift home. While waiting I
called BMW to ask if they offered anything like priority service for travelers.
Nien. That's up to each dealership. I called the dealership to ask the same. I
was assured the bike would be looked at and I'd have an estimate before the end
of day but it was definitely not going to be fixed that day. I never did get
that call.</p>
<p>I did get a call this morning (Tuesday) with an estimate. The estimate was less
than I feared, but some of the parts would need to be ordered in from Germany,
with a delivery time of 7 - 10 days. I forgot to ask if those were weekdays or
business days. Also, I am supposed to be leaving on a trip to Maine, USA, in
ten days. Oh dear... I called back. One of the service people offered to try
getting the parts from BMW in the US, but it didn't sound promising. Again,
promised a call before the end of the day, but no such call was to be had.</p>
<p>This is not going well!</p>
