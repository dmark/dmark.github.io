    <p>I started "<a href="https://andyfrisella.com/pages/75hard-info">75 Hard</a>" today. I
don't know why. I stumbled across the app and decided to do it. As much as I
don't like the word "motivation"[ref]<a href="https://www.jimwendler.com">discipline over
motivation</a>[/ref], I seem to be motivated to do
this.</p>
<p>For exercise I will do alternating days as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Day 1: 45 minutes of weight training, and one ~45 minute walk.</li>
<li>Day 2: two ~45 minutes walks.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't have a squat rack so I'll improvise on the weight training. Deadlifts
plus excercises I can do by cleaning the bar. I can do front squats but the
weight is super light so go for high rep sets or maybe do thrusters instead.
And I can press.</p>
<h1>Background</h1>
<ul>
<li>2006 - 2009 I was an avid runner. Not elite by any means but good enough to be in the top 25 - 33% of the pack for my age category.</li>
<li>In 2009 I damaged the articular cartilage in my left knee. I could no longer run, unless I had surgery.</li>
<li>The knee injury led me to strength training and <a href="https://startingstrength.com">Starting Strength</a>. Mercifully, the articular cartilage damage did not seem to bother me when squatting or deadlifting.</li>
<li>Strength training led me to my local CrossFit gym, which led me to olympic weightlifting.</li>
<li>July 21, 2014 I set my still current squat 1RM at 315lbs.</li>
<li>July 25, 2014 I set my still current clean 1RM at 97kg. My back spasmed that evening which set in motion years of inconsistent training and general laziness. I eventually drifted away from the gym.</li>
<li>Nonetheless, somewhere in there I bought myself a complete Eleiko Sport Training olympic weightlifting set up.</li>
<li>February of 2021 I hit a body weight of 209.7lbs. At 5'8" and being pretty much completely de-trained, I had absolutely no business being that heavy. I mean, blame some of it on COVID I suppose but blame all of it on a lack of discipline. Quoting Jim Wendler, "It takes no talent to be in shape. It just takes a modicum of discipline to do what is necessary."</li>
<li>Over the next few months I got down to about 199lbs.</li>
<li>During a ~week long motorcycle trip to Pickle Lake, Ontario, I lost another ~5lbs. My waist was still above ~40", but this was progress.</li>
</ul>
